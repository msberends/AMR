\item \code{abbr}\cr List of abbreviations as used in many countries, also for antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST)
\item \code{synonyms}\cr Synonyms (often trade names) of a drug, as found in PubChem based on their compound ID

\description{
Two data sets containing all antibiotics/antimycotics and antivirals. Use \code{\link[=as.ab]{as.ab()}} or one of the \code{\link[=ab_property]{ab_*}} functions to retrieve values from the \link{antibiotics} data set. Three identifiers are included in this data set: an antibiotic ID (\code{ab}, primarily used in this package) as defined by WHONET/EARS-Net, an ATC code (\code{atc}) as defined by the WHO, and a Compound ID (\code{cid}) as found in PubChem. Other properties in this data set are derived from one or more of these codes. Note that some drugs have multiple ATC codes.
}
\details{
Properties that are based on an ATC code are only available when an ATC is available. These properties are: \code{atc_group1}, \code{atc_group2}, \code{oral_ddd}, \code{oral_units}, \code{iv_ddd} and \code{iv_units}.

Synonyms (i.e. trade names) were derived from the PubChem Compound ID (column \code{cid}) and consequently only available where a CID is available.

This package contains \strong{all ~550 antibiotic, antimycotic and antiviral drugs} and their Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) codes, ATC groups and Defined Daily Dose (DDD) from the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology (WHOCC, \url{https://www.whocc.no}) and the Pharmaceuticals Community Register of the European Commission (\url{https://ec.europa.eu/health/documents/community-register/html/reg_hum_atc.htm}).

These have become the gold standard for international drug utilisation monitoring and research.

The WHOCC is located in Oslo at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health and funded by the Norwegian government. The European Commission is the executive of the European Union and promotes its general interest.
