\title{Data Set with 48,787 Microorganisms}
\format{
A \link[tibble:tibble]{tibble} with 48,787 observations and 22 variables:
\itemize{
\item \code{mo}\cr ID of microorganism as used by this package
\item \code{fullname}\cr Full name, like \code{"Escherichia coli"}. For the taxonomic ranks genus, species and subspecies, this is the 'pasted' text of genus, species, and subspecies. For all taxonomic ranks higher than genus, this is the name of the taxon.
\item \code{status} \cr Status of the taxon, either "accepted" or "synonym"
\item \code{kingdom}, \code{phylum}, \code{class}, \code{order}, \code{family}, \code{genus}, \code{species}, \code{subspecies}\cr Taxonomic rank of the microorganism
\item \code{rank}\cr Text of the taxonomic rank of the microorganism, such as \code{"species"} or \code{"genus"}
\item \code{ref}\cr Author(s) and year of related scientific publication. This contains only the \emph{first surname} and year of the \emph{latest} authors, e.g. "Wallis \emph{et al.} 2006 \emph{emend.} Smith and Jones 2018" becomes "Smith \emph{et al.}, 2018". This field is directly retrieved from the source specified in the column \code{source}. Moreover, accents were removed to comply with CRAN that only allows ASCII characters, e.g. "Váňová" becomes "Vanova".
\item \code{lpsn}\cr Identifier ('Record number') of the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN). This will be the first/highest LPSN identifier to keep one identifier per row. For example, \emph{Acetobacter ascendens} has LPSN Record number 7864 and 11011. Only the first is available in the \code{microorganisms} data set.
\item \code{lpsn_parent}\cr LPSN identifier of the parent taxon
\item \code{lpsn_renamed_to}\cr LPSN identifier of the currently valid taxon
\item \code{gbif}\cr Identifier ('taxonID') of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)
\item \code{gbif_parent}\cr GBIF identifier of the parent taxon
\item \code{gbif_renamed_to}\cr GBIF identifier of the currently valid taxon
\item \code{source}\cr Either "GBIF", "LPSN" or "manually added" (see \emph{Source})
\item \code{prevalence}\cr Prevalence of the microorganism, see \code{\link[=as.mo]{as.mo()}}
\item \code{snomed}\cr Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) code of the microorganism, version of 1 July, 2021 (see \emph{Source}). Use \code{\link[=mo_snomed]{mo_snomed()}} to retrieve it quickly, see \code{\link[=mo_property]{mo_property()}}.

\description{
A data set containing the full microbial taxonomy (\strong{last updated: 12 September, 2022}) of five kingdoms from the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). This data set is the backbone of this \code{AMR} package. MO codes can be looked up using \code{\link[=as.mo]{as.mo()}}.
}
\details{
Please note that entries are only based on the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) (see below). Since these sources incorporate entries based on (recent) publications in the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology (IJSEM), it can happen that the year of publication is sometimes later than one might expect.

For example, \emph{Staphylococcus pettenkoferi} was described for the first time in Diagnostic Microbiology and Infectious Disease in 2002 (\doi{10.1016/s0732-8893(02)00399-1}), but it was not before 2007 that a publication in IJSEM followed (\doi{10.1099/ijs.0.64381-0}). Consequently, the \code{AMR} package returns 2007 for \code{mo_year("S. pettenkoferi")}.

\section{Included Taxa}{

Included taxonomic data are:
\itemize{
\item All ~34,000 (sub)species from the kingdoms of Archaea and Bacteria
\item ~7,400 (sub)species from the kingdom of Fungi. The kingdom of Fungi is a very large taxon with almost 300,000 different (sub)species, of which most are not microbial (but rather macroscopic, like mushrooms). Because of this, not all fungi fit the scope of this package. Only relevant fungi are covered (such as all species of \emph{Aspergillus}, \emph{Candida}, \emph{Cryptococcus}, \emph{Histoplasma}, \emph{Pneumocystis}, \emph{Saccharomyces} and \emph{Trichophyton}).
\item ~4,900 (sub)species from the kingdom of Protozoa
\item ~1,500 (sub)species from ~50 other relevant genera from the kingdom of Animalia (such as \emph{Strongyloides} and \emph{Taenia})
\item All ~9,400 previously accepted names of all included (sub)species (these were taxonomically renamed)
\item The complete taxonomic tree of all included (sub)species: from kingdom to subspecies
\item The identifier of the parent taxons
\item The year and first author of the related scientific publication
}
\subsection{Manual additions}{

For convenience, some entries were added manually:
\itemize{
\item 11 entries of \emph{Streptococcus} (beta-haemolytic: groups A, B, C, D, F, G, H, K and unspecified; other: viridans, milleri)
\item 2 entries of \emph{Staphylococcus} (coagulase-negative (CoNS) and coagulase-positive (CoPS))
\item 1 entry of \emph{Blastocystis} (\emph{B.  hominis}), although it officially does not exist (Noel \emph{et al.} 2005, PMID 15634993)
\item 1 entry of \emph{Moraxella} (\emph{M. catarrhalis}), which was formally named \emph{Branhamella catarrhalis} (Catlin, 1970) though this change was never accepted within the field of clinical microbiology
\item 5 other 'undefined' entries (unknown, unknown Gram negatives, unknown Gram positives, unknown yeast and unknown fungus)
}

\section{About the Records from LPSN (see \emph{Source})}{

LPSN is the main source for bacteriological taxonomy of this \code{AMR} package.

The List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) provides comprehensive information on the nomenclature of prokaryotes. LPSN is a free to use service founded by Jean P. Euzeby in 1997 and later on maintained by Aidan C. Parte.
