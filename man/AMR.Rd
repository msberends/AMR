\description{
Welcome to the \code{AMR} package.

The \code{AMR} package is a \href{https://msberends.github.io/AMR/#copyright}{free and open-source} R package with \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell}{zero dependencies} to simplify the analysis and prediction of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) and to work with microbial and antimicrobial data and properties, by using evidence-based methods. \strong{Our aim is to provide a standard} for clean and reproducible AMR data analysis, that can therefore empower epidemiological analyses to continuously enable surveillance and treatment evaluation in any setting. \href{https://msberends.github.io/AMR/authors.html}{Many different researchers} from around the globe are continually helping us to make this a successful and durable project!

This work was published in the Journal of Statistical Software (Volume 104(3); \doi{jss.v104.i03}) and formed the basis of two PhD theses (\doi{10.33612/diss.177417131} and \doi{10.33612/diss.192486375}).

After installing this package, R knows \href{https://msberends.github.io/AMR/reference/microorganisms.html}{\strong{~52 000 microorganisms}} (updated December 2022) and all \href{https://msberends.github.io/AMR/reference/antibiotics.html}{\strong{~600 antibiotic, antimycotic and antiviral drugs}} by name and code (including ATC, EARS-Net, ASIARS-Net, PubChem, LOINC and SNOMED CT), and knows all about valid SIR and MIC values. The integral clinical breakpoint guidelines from CLSI and EUCAST are included, even with epidemiological cut-off (ECOFF) values. It supports and can read any data format, including WHONET data. This package works on Windows, macOS and Linux with all versions of R since R-3.0 (April 2013). \strong{It was designed to work in any setting, including those with very limited resources}. It was created for both routine data analysis and academic research at the Faculty of Medical Sciences of the \href{https://www.rug.nl}{University of Groningen}, in collaboration with non-profit organisations \href{https://www.certe.nl}{Certe Medical Diagnostics and Advice Foundation} and \href{https://www.umcg.nl}{University Medical Center Groningen}.

The \code{AMR} package is available in English, Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, and Ukrainian. Antimicrobial drug (group) names and colloquial microorganism names are provided in these languages.
