\title{Transform Input to an Antibiotic ID}
\usage{
as.ab(x, flag_multiple_results = TRUE, info = interactive(), ...)

is.ab(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \link{character} vector to determine to antibiotic ID}

\item{flag_multiple_results}{a \link{logical} to indicate whether a note should be printed to the console that probably more than one antibiotic code or name can be retrieved from a single input value.}

\item{info}{a \link{logical} to indicate whether a progress bar should be printed, defaults to \code{TRUE} only in interactive mode}

\item{...}{arguments passed on to internal functions}
}
\value{
A \link{character} \link{vector} with additional class \code{\link{ab}}
}
\description{
Use this function to determine the antibiotic code of one or more antibiotics. The data set \link{antibiotics} will be searched for abbreviations, official names and synonyms (brand names).
}
\details{
All entries in the \link{antibiotics} data set have three different identifiers: a human readable EARS-Net code (column \code{ab}, used by ECDC and WHONET), an ATC code (column \code{atc}, used by WHO), and a CID code (column \code{cid}, Compound ID, used by PubChem). The data set contains more than 5,000 official brand names from many different countries, as found in PubChem. Not that some drugs contain multiple ATC codes.

All these properties will be searched for the user input. The \code{\link[=as.ab]{as.ab()}} can correct for different forms of misspelling:
\itemize{
\item Wrong spelling of drug names (such as "tobramicin" or "gentamycin"), which corrects for most audible similarities such as f/ph, x/ks, c/z/s, t/th, etc.
\item Too few or too many vowels or consonants
\item Switching two characters (such as "mreopenem", often the case in clinical data, when doctors typed too fast)
\item Digitalised paper records, leaving artefacts like 0/o/O (zero and O's), B/8, n/r, etc.
}

Use the \code{\link[=ab_property]{ab_*}} functions to get properties based on the returned antibiotic ID, see \emph{Examples}.

Note: the \code{\link[=as.ab]{as.ab()}} and \code{\link[=ab_property]{ab_*}} functions may use very long regular expression to match brand names of antimicrobial agents. This may fail on some systems.

You can add your own manual codes to be considered by \code{\link[=as.ab]{as.ab()}} and all \code{\link[=ab_property]{ab_*}} functions, see \code{\link[=add_custom_antimicrobials]{add_custom_antimicrobials()}}.

This package contains \strong{all ~550 antibiotic, antimycotic and antiviral drugs} and their Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) codes, ATC groups and Defined Daily Dose (DDD) from the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology (WHOCC, \url{https://www.whocc.no}) and the Pharmaceuticals Community Register of the European Commission (\url{https://ec.europa.eu/health/documents/community-register/html/reg_hum_atc.htm}).

These have become the gold standard for international drug utilisation monitoring and research.
