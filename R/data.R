# ==================================================================== #

#' Data Sets with `r format(nrow(antibiotics) + nrow(antivirals), big.mark = " ")` Antimicrobial Drugs
#'
#' Two data sets containing all antibiotics/antimycotics and antivirals. Use [as.ab()] or one of the [`ab_*`][ab_property()] functions to retrieve values from the [antibiotics] data set. Three identifiers are included in this data set: an antibiotic ID (`ab`, primarily used in this package) as defined by WHONET/EARS-Net, an ATC code (`atc`) as defined by the WHO, and a Compound ID (`cid`) as found in PubChem. Other properties in this data set are derived from one or more of these codes. Note that some drugs have multiple ATC codes.
#' @format
#' ### For the [antibiotics] data set: a [tibble][tibble::tibble] with `r nrow(antibiotics)` observations and `r ncol(antibiotics)` variables:
#' - `ab`\cr Antibiotic ID as used in this package (such as `AMC`), using the official EARS-Net (European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network) codes where available
#' - `cid`\cr Compound ID as found in PubChem
#' - `name`\cr Official name as used by WHONET/EARS-Net or the WHO
#' - `group`\cr A short and concise group name, based on WHONET and WHOCC definitions
#' - `atc`\cr ATC codes (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical) as defined by the WHOCC, like `J01CR02`

#' - `atc_group2`\cr Official chemical subgroup (4th level ATC code) as defined by the WHOCC, like `"Macrolides"`
#' - `abbr`\cr List of abbreviations as used in many countries, also for antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST)
#' - `synonyms`\cr Synonyms (often trade names) of a drug, as found in PubChem based on their compound ID
#' - `oral_ddd`\cr Defined Daily Dose (DDD), oral treatment, currently available for `r sum(!is.na(antibiotics$oral_ddd))` drugs
#' - `oral_units`\cr Units of `oral_ddd`
#' - `iv_ddd`\cr Defined Daily Dose (DDD), parenteral (intravenous) treatment, currently available for `r sum(!is.na(antibiotics$iv_ddd))` drugs
#' - `iv_units`\cr Units of `iv_ddd`
#' - `loinc`\cr All LOINC codes (Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes) associated with the name of the antimicrobial drug. Use [ab_loinc()] to retrieve them quickly, see [ab_property()].
#'
#' ### For the [antivirals] data set: a [tibble][tibble::tibble] with `r nrow(antivirals)` observations and `r ncol(antivirals)` variables:
#' - `av`\cr Antibiotic ID as used in this package (such as `AMC`), using the official EARS-Net (European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network) codes where available
#' - `name`\cr Official name as used by WHONET/EARS-Net or the WHO
#' - `atc`\cr ATC codes (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical) as defined by the WHOCC
#' - `cid`\cr Compound ID as found in PubChem
#' - `atc_group`\cr Official pharmacological subgroup (3rd level ATC code) as defined by the WHOCC
#' - `synonyms`\cr Synonyms (often trade names) of a drug, as found in PubChem based on their compound ID
#' - `oral_ddd`\cr Defined Daily Dose (DDD), oral treatment
#' - `oral_units`\cr Units of `oral_ddd`
#' - `iv_ddd`\cr Defined Daily Dose (DDD), parenteral treatment
#' - `iv_units`\cr Units of `iv_ddd`
#' - `loinc`\cr All LOINC codes (Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes) associated with the name of the antimicrobial drug.
#' @details Properties that are based on an ATC code are only available when an ATC is available. These properties are: `atc_group1`, `atc_group2`, `oral_ddd`, `oral_units`, `iv_ddd` and `iv_units`.
#'
#' Synonyms (i.e. trade names) were derived from the PubChem Compound ID (column `cid`) and consequently only available where a CID is available.

#' Data Set with `r format(nrow(microorganisms), big.mark = " ")` Microorganisms
#'
#' A data set containing the full microbial taxonomy (**last updated: `r documentation_date(max(TAXONOMY_VERSION$GBIF$accessed_date, TAXONOMY_VERSION$LPSN$accessed_date))`**) of `r nr2char(length(unique(microorganisms$kingdom[!microorganisms$kingdom %like% "unknown"])))` kingdoms from the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). This data set is the backbone of this `AMR` package. MO codes can be looked up using [as.mo()].
#' @format A [tibble][tibble::tibble] with `r format(nrow(microorganisms), big.mark = " ")` observations and `r ncol(microorganisms)` variables:
#' - `mo`\cr ID of microorganism as used by this package
#' - `fullname`\cr Full name, like `"Escherichia coli"`. For the taxonomic ranks genus, species and subspecies, this is the 'pasted' text of genus, species, and subspecies. For all taxonomic ranks higher than genus, this is the name of the taxon.
#' - `status` \cr Status of the taxon, either `r vector_or(microorganisms$status)`
#' - `kingdom`, `phylum`, `class`, `order`, `family`, `genus`, `species`, `subspecies`\cr Taxonomic rank of the microorganism
#' - `rank`\cr Text of the taxonomic rank of the microorganism, such as `"species"` or `"genus"`
#' - `ref`\cr Author(s) and year of related scientific publication. This contains only the *first surname* and year of the *latest* authors, e.g. "Wallis *et al.* 2006 *emend.* Smith and Jones 2018" becomes "Smith *et al.*, 2018". This field is directly retrieved from the source specified in the column `source`. Moreover, accents were removed to comply with CRAN that only allows ASCII characters, e.g. "V`r "\u00e1\u0148ov\u00e1"`" becomes "Vanova".
#' - `lpsn`\cr Identifier ('Record number') of the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN). This will be the first/highest LPSN identifier to keep one identifier per row. For example, *Acetobacter ascendens* has LPSN Record number 7864 and 11011. Only the first is available in the `microorganisms` data set.
#' - `oxygen_tolerance` \cr Oxygen tolerance, either `r vector_or(microorganisms$oxygen_tolerance)`. These data were retrieved from BacDive (see *Source*). Items that contain "likely" are missing from BacDive and were extrapolated from other species within the same genus to guess the oxygen tolerance. Currently `r round(length(microorganisms$oxygen_tolerance[which(!is.na(microorganisms$oxygen_tolerance))]) / nrow(microorganisms[which(microorganisms$kingdom == "Bacteria"), ]) * 100, 1)`% of all `r format_included_data_number(nrow(microorganisms[which(microorganisms$kingdom == "Bacteria"), ]))` bacteria in the data set contain an oxygen tolerance.
#' - `lpsn_parent`\cr LPSN identifier of the parent taxon
#' - `lpsn_renamed_to`\cr LPSN identifier of the currently valid taxon
#' - `gbif`\cr Identifier ('taxonID') of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)
#' - `gbif_parent`\cr GBIF identifier of the parent taxon
#' - `gbif_renamed_to`\cr GBIF identifier of the currently valid taxon
#' - `source`\cr Either `r vector_or(microorganisms$source)` (see *Source*)
#' - `prevalence`\cr Prevalence of the microorganism according to Bartlett *et al.* (2022, \doi{10.1099/mic.0.001269}), see [mo_matching_score()] for the full explanation
#' - `snomed`\cr Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) code of the microorganism, version of `r documentation_date(TAXONOMY_VERSION$SNOMED$accessed_date)` (see *Source*). Use [mo_snomed()] to retrieve it quickly, see [mo_property()].
#' @details
#' Please note that entries are only based on the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) (see below). Since these sources incorporate entries based on (recent) publications in the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology (IJSEM), it can happen that the year of publication is sometimes later than one might expect.
#'
#' For example, *Staphylococcus pettenkoferi* was described for the first time in Diagnostic Microbiology and Infectious Disease in 2002 (\doi{10.1016/s0732-8893(02)00399-1}), but it was not before 2007 that a publication in IJSEM followed (\doi{10.1099/ijs.0.64381-0}). Consequently, the `AMR` package returns 2007 for `mo_year("S. pettenkoferi")`.
#'
#' @section Included Taxa:
#' Included taxonomic data are:
#' - All `r format_included_data_number(microorganisms[which(microorganisms$kingdom %in% c("Archeae", "Bacteria")), , drop = FALSE])` (sub)species from the kingdoms of Archaea and Bacteria
#' - `r format_included_data_number(microorganisms[which(microorganisms$kingdom == "Fungi"), , drop = FALSE])` (sub)species from the kingdom of Fungi. The kingdom of Fungi is a very large taxon with almost 300,000 different (sub)species, of which most are not microbial (but rather macroscopic, like mushrooms). Because of this, not all fungi fit the scope of this package. Only relevant fungi are covered (such as all species of *Aspergillus*, *Candida*, *Cryptococcus*, *Histoplasma*, *Pneumocystis*, *Saccharomyces* and *Trichophyton*).
#' - `r format_included_data_number(microorganisms[which(microorganisms$kingdom == "Protozoa"), , drop = FALSE])` (sub)species from the kingdom of Protozoa
#' - `r format_included_data_number(microorganisms[which(microorganisms$kingdom == "Animalia"), , drop = FALSE])` (sub)species from `r format_included_data_number(microorganisms[which(microorganisms$kingdom == "Animalia"), "genus", drop = TRUE])` other relevant genera from the kingdom of Animalia (such as *Strongyloides* and *Taenia*)
#' - All `r format_included_data_number(microorganisms[which(microorganisms$status != "accepted"), , drop = FALSE])` previously accepted names of all included (sub)species (these were taxonomically renamed)
#' - The complete taxonomic tree of all included (sub)species: from kingdom to subspecies
#' - The identifier of the parent taxons
#' - The year and first author of the related scientific publication
#'
#' ### Manual additions
#' For convenience, some entries were added manually:
#'
#' - `r format_included_data_number(microorganisms[which(microorganisms$source == "manually added" & microorganisms$genus == "Salmonella"), , drop = FALSE])` entries of *Salmonella*, such as the city-like serovars and groups A to H
#' - `r format_included_data_number(microorganisms[which(microorganisms$source == "manually added" & microorganisms$genus == "Streptococcus"), , drop = FALSE])` entries of *Streptococcus*, such as the beta-haemolytic groups A to K, viridans, and milleri
#' - 2 entries of *Staphylococcus* (coagulase-negative (CoNS) and coagulase-positive (CoPS))
#' - 1 entry of *Blastocystis* (*B.  hominis*), although it officially does not exist (Noel *et al.* 2005, PMID 15634993)
#' - 1 entry of *Moraxella* (*M. catarrhalis*), which was formally named *Branhamella catarrhalis* (Catlin, 1970) though this change was never accepted within the field of clinical microbiology
#' - 8 other 'undefined' entries (unknown, unknown Gram-negatives, unknown Gram-positives, unknown yeast, unknown fungus, and unknown anaerobic Gram-pos/Gram-neg bacteria)
#'

#' Data Set with Treatment Dosages as Defined by EUCAST
#'
#' EUCAST breakpoints used in this package are based on the dosages in this data set. They can be retrieved with [eucast_dosage()].
#' @format A [tibble][tibble::tibble] with `r format(nrow(dosage), big.mark = " ")` observations and `r ncol(dosage)` variables:
#' - `ab`\cr Antibiotic ID as used in this package (such as `AMC`), using the official EARS-Net (European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network) codes where available
#' - `name`\cr Official name of the antimicrobial drug as used by WHONET/EARS-Net or the WHO
#' - `type`\cr Type of the dosage, either `r vector_or(dosage$type)`
#' - `dose`\cr Dose, such as "2 g" or "25 mg/kg"
#' - `dose_times`\cr Number of times a dose must be administered
#' - `administration`\cr Route of administration, either `r vector_or(dosage$administration)`
#' - `notes`\cr Additional dosage notes
#' - `original_txt`\cr Original text in the PDF file of EUCAST
#' - `eucast_version`\cr Version number of the EUCAST Clinical Breakpoints guideline to which these dosages apply, either `r vector_or(dosage$eucast_version, quotes = FALSE, sort = TRUE, reverse = TRUE)`
