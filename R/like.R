#' Vectorised Pattern Matching with Keyboard Shortcut
#'
#' Convenient wrapper around [grepl()] to match a pattern: `x %like% pattern`. It always returns a [`logical`] vector and is always case-insensitive (use `x %like_case% pattern` for case-sensitive matching). Also, `pattern` can be as long as `x` to compare items of each index in both vectors, or they both can have the same length to iterate over all cases.
#' @param x a [character] vector where matches are sought, or an object which can be coerced by [as.character()] to a [character] vector.
#' @param pattern a [character] vector containing regular expressions (or a [character] string for `fixed = TRUE`) to be matched in the given [character] vector. Coerced by [as.character()] to a [character] string if possible.
#' @param ignore.case if `FALSE`, the pattern matching is *case sensitive* and if `TRUE`, case is ignored during matching.
#' @return A [logical] vector

#' @details
#' These [like()] and `%like%`/`%unlike%` functions:
#' * Are case-insensitive (use `%like_case%`/`%unlike_case%` for case-sensitive matching)
#' * Support multiple patterns
#' * Check if `pattern` is a valid regular expression and sets `fixed = TRUE` if not, to greatly improve speed (vectorised over `pattern`)
#' * Always use compatibility with Perl unless `fixed = TRUE`, to greatly improve speed
#'
#' Using RStudio? The `%like%`/`%unlike%` functions can also be directly inserted in your code from the Addins menu and can have its own keyboard shortcut like `Shift+Ctrl+L` or `Shift+Cmd+L` (see menu `Tools` > `Modify Keyboard Shortcuts...`). If you keep pressing your shortcut, the inserted text will be iterated over `%like%` -> `%unlike%` -> `%like_case%` -> `%unlike_case%`.
#' @source Idea from the [`like` function from the `data.table` package](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/blob/ec1259af1bf13fc0c96a1d3f9e84d55d8106a9a4/R/like.R), although altered as explained in *Details*.
