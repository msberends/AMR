#' The `AMR` Package
#'
#' @description
#' Welcome to the `AMR` package.
#'
#' The `AMR` package is a [free and open-source](https://msberends.github.io/AMR/#copyright) R package with [zero dependencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell) to simplify the analysis and prediction of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) and to work with microbial and antimicrobial data and properties, by using evidence-based methods. **Our aim is to provide a standard** for clean and reproducible AMR data analysis, that can therefore empower epidemiological analyses to continuously enable surveillance and treatment evaluation in any setting. [Many different researchers](https://msberends.github.io/AMR/authors.html) from around the globe are continually helping us to make this a successful and durable project!
#'
#' This work was published in the Journal of Statistical Software (Volume 104(3); \doi{jss.v104.i03}) and formed the basis of two PhD theses (\doi{10.33612/diss.177417131} and \doi{10.33612/diss.192486375}).
#'
#' After installing this package, R knows [**`r format_included_data_number(AMR::microorganisms)` microorganisms**](https://msberends.github.io/AMR/reference/microorganisms.html) (updated `r format(TAXONOMY_VERSION$GBIF$accessed_date, "%B %Y")`) and all [**`r format_included_data_number(nrow(AMR::antibiotics) + nrow(AMR::antivirals))` antibiotic, antimycotic and antiviral drugs**](https://msberends.github.io/AMR/reference/antibiotics.html) by name and code (including ATC, EARS-Net, ASIARS-Net, PubChem, LOINC and SNOMED CT), and knows all about valid SIR and MIC values. The integral clinical breakpoint guidelines from CLSI and EUCAST are included, even with epidemiological cut-off (ECOFF) values. It supports and can read any data format, including WHONET data. This package works on Windows, macOS and Linux with all versions of R since R-3.0 (April 2013). **It was designed to work in any setting, including those with very limited resources**. It was created for both routine data analysis and academic research at the Faculty of Medical Sciences of the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl), in collaboration with non-profit organisations [Certe Medical Diagnostics and Advice Foundation](https://www.certe.nl) and [University Medical Center Groningen](https://www.umcg.nl).
#'
#' The `AMR` package is available in `r vector_and(vapply(FUN.VALUE = character(1), LANGUAGES_SUPPORTED_NAMES, function(x) x$exonym), quotes = FALSE, sort = FALSE)`. Antimicrobial drug (group) names and colloquial microorganism names are provided in these languages.
#' @section Reference Data Publicly Available:
#' All data sets in this `AMR` package (about microorganisms, antibiotics, SIR interpretation, EUCAST rules, etc.) are publicly and freely available for download in the following formats: R, MS Excel, Apache Feather, Apache Parquet, SPSS, SAS, and Stata. We also provide tab-separated plain text files that are machine-readable and suitable for input in any software program, such as laboratory information systems. Please visit [our website for the download links](https://msberends.github.io/AMR/articles/datasets.html). The actual files are of course available on [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/msberends/AMR/tree/main/data-raw).
