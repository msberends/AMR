#' Kurtosis of the Sample
#'
#' @description Kurtosis is a measure of the "tailedness" of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable. A normal distribution has a kurtosis of 3 and a excess kurtosis of 0.
#' @param x a vector of values, a [matrix] or a [data.frame]
#' @param na.rm a [logical] to indicate whether `NA` values should be stripped before the computation proceeds
#' @param excess a [logical] to indicate whether the *excess kurtosis* should be returned, defined as the kurtosis minus 3.
#' @seealso [skewness()]
#' @rdname kurtosis
#' @export
#' @examples
