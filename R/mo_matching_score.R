#' Calculate the Matching Score for Microorganisms
#'
#' This algorithm is used by [as.mo()] and all the [`mo_*`][mo_property()] functions to determine the most probable match of taxonomic records based on user input.
#' @author Dr. Matthijs Berends
#' @param x Any user input value(s)
#' @param n A full taxonomic name, that exists in [`microorganisms$fullname`][microorganisms]
#' @note This algorithm was described in: Berends MS *et al.* (2022). **AMR: An R Package for Working with Antimicrobial Resistance Data**. *Journal of Statistical Software*, 104(3), 1-31; \doi{10.18637/jss.v104.i03}.
#' @section Matching Score for Microorganisms:
#' With ambiguous user input in [as.mo()] and all the [`mo_*`][mo_property()] functions, the returned results are chosen based on their matching score using [mo_matching_score()]. This matching score \eqn{m}, is calculated as:
#'
#' \ifelse{latex}{\deqn{m_{(x, n)} = \frac{l_{n} - 0.5 \cdot \min \begin{cases}l_{n} \\ \textrm{lev}(x, n)\end{cases}}{l_{n} \cdot p_{n} \cdot k_{n}}}}{\ifelse{html}{\figure{mo_matching_score.png}{options: width="300" alt="mo matching score"}}{m(x, n) = ( l_n * min(l_n, lev(x, n) ) ) / ( l_n * p_n * k_n )}}
#'
#' where:
#'
#' * \ifelse{html}{\out{<i>x</i> is the user input;}}{\eqn{x} is the user input;}
#' * \ifelse{html}{\out{<i>n</i> is a taxonomic name (genus, species, and subspecies);}}{\eqn{n} is a taxonomic name (genus, species, and subspecies);}
#' * \ifelse{html}{\out{<i>l<sub>n</sub></i> is the length of <i>n</i>;}}{l_n is the length of \eqn{n};}
#' * \ifelse{html}{\out{<i>lev</i> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Levenshtein distance function</a> (counting any insertion as 1, and any deletion or substitution as 2) that is needed to change <i>x</i> into <i>n</i>;}}{lev is the Levenshtein distance function (counting any insertion as 1, and any deletion or substitution as 2) that is needed to change \eqn{x} into \eqn{n};}
#' * \ifelse{html}{\out{<i>p<sub>n</sub></i> is the human pathogenic prevalence group of <i>n</i>, as described below;}}{p_n is the human pathogenic prevalence group of \eqn{n}, as described below;}
#' * \ifelse{html}{\out{<i>k<sub>n</sub></i> is the taxonomic kingdom of <i>n</i>, set as Bacteria = 1, Fungi = 2, Protozoa = 3, Archaea = 4, others = 5.}}{l_n is the taxonomic kingdom of \eqn{n}, set as Bacteria = 1, Fungi = 2, Protozoa = 3, Archaea = 4, others = 5.}
#'
#' The grouping into human pathogenic prevalence (\eqn{p}) is based on experience from several microbiological laboratories in the Netherlands in conjunction with international reports on pathogen prevalence:
#'
#' **Group 1** (most prevalent microorganisms) consists of all microorganisms where the taxonomic class is Gammaproteobacteria or where the taxonomic genus is *Enterococcus*, *Staphylococcus* or *Streptococcus*. This group consequently contains all common Gram-negative bacteria, such as *Pseudomonas* and *Legionella* and all species within the order Enterobacterales.
#'
#' **Group 2** consists of all microorganisms where the taxonomic phylum is Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria or Sarcomastigophora, or where the taxonomic genus is `r vector_or(MO_PREVALENT_GENERA, quotes = "*")`.
#'
#' **Group 3** consists of all other microorganisms.
#'
#' All characters in \eqn{x} and \eqn{n} are ignored that are other than A-Z, a-z, 0-9, spaces and parentheses.
#'
#' All matches are sorted descending on their matching score and for all user input values, the top match will be returned. This will lead to the effect that e.g., `"E. coli"` will return the microbial ID of *Escherichia coli* (\eqn{m = `r round(mo_matching_score("E. coli", "Escherichia coli"), 3)`}, a highly prevalent microorganism found in humans) and not *Entamoeba coli* (\eqn{m = `r round(mo_matching_score("E. coli", "Entamoeba coli"), 3)`}, a less prevalent microorganism in humans), although the latter would alphabetically come first.
