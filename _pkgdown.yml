reference:
  - title: "Preparing data: microorganisms"
    desc: >
      These functions are meant to get taxonomically valid properties of microorganisms from any input.
      Use `mo_source()` to teach this package how to translate your own codes to valid microorganism codes.
    contents:
    - "`as.mo`"
    - "`mo_property`"
    - "`mo_source`"

  - title: "Preparing data: antibiotics"
    desc: >
      Use these functions to get valid properties of antibiotics from any input or to clean your input.
      You can even retrieve drug names and doses from clinical text records, using `ab_from_text()`.
    contents:
    - "`as.ab`"
    - "`ab_property`"
    - "`ab_from_text`"
    - "`atc_online_property`"
    - "`add_custom_antimicrobials`"

  - title: "Preparing data: antimicrobial resistance"
    desc: >
      With `as.mic()` and `as.disk()` you can transform your raw input to valid MIC or disk diffusion values.
      Use `as.rsi()` for cleaning raw data to let it only contain "R", "I" and "S", or to interpret MIC or disk diffusion values as R/SI based on the lastest EUCAST and CLSI guidelines.
      Afterwards, you can extend antibiotic interpretations by applying [EUCAST rules](https://www.eucast.org/expert_rules_and_intrinsic_resistance/) with `eucast_rules()`.
    contents:
    - "`as.rsi`"
    - "`as.mic`"
    - "`as.disk`"
    - "`eucast_rules`"
    - "`custom_eucast_rules`"

  - title: "Analysing data: antimicrobial resistance"
    desc: >
      Use these function for the analysis part. You can use `susceptibility()` or `resistance()` on any antibiotic column.
      Be sure to first select the isolates that are appropiate for analysis, by using `first_isolate()` or `is_new_episode()`.
      You can also filter your data on certain resistance in certain antibiotic classes (`carbapenems()`, `aminoglycosides()`), or determine multi-drug resistant microorganisms (MDRO, `mdro()`).
    contents:
    - "`proportion`"
    - "`count`"
    - "`is_new_episode`"
    - "`first_isolate`"
    - "`key_antimicrobials`"
    - "`mdro`"
    - "`count`"
    - "`plot`"
    - "`ggplot_rsi`"
    - "`bug_drug_combinations`"
    - "`antibiotic_class_selectors`"
    - "`mean_amr_distance`"
    - "`resistance_predict`"
    - "`guess_ab_col`"
    
  - title: "Other: antiviral drugs"
    desc: >
      This package also provides extensive support for antiviral agents, even though it is not the primary
      scope of this package. Working with data containing information about antiviral drugs was never easier.
      Use these functions to get valid properties of antiviral drugs from any input or to clean your input.
      You can even retrieve drug names and doses from clinical text records, using `av_from_text()`.
    contents:
    - "`as.av`"
    - "`av_property`"
    - "`av_from_text`"

  - title: "Other: background information on included data"
    desc: >
      Some pages about our package and its external sources. Be sure to read our [How To's](./../articles/index.html)
      for more information about how to work with functions in this package.
    contents:
    - "`AMR`"
    - "`example_isolates`"
    - "`microorganisms`"
    - "`microorganisms.codes`"
    - "`antibiotics`"
    - "`intrinsic_resistant`"
    - "`dosage`"

    - "`example_isolates_unclean`"
    - "`rsi_translation`"
    - "`WHONET`"

  - title: "Other: miscellaneous functions"
    desc: >
      These functions are mostly for internal use, but some of
      them may also be suitable for your analysis. Especially the
      'like' function can be useful: `if (x %like% y) {...}`.
    contents:
    - "`age_groups`"
    - "`age`"
    - "`availability`"
    - "`get_AMR_locale`"
    - "`ggplot_pca`"
    - "`italicise_taxonomy`"
    - "`join`"
    - "`like`"
    - "`mo_matching_score`"
    - "`pca`"
    - "`random`"

  - title: "Other: statistical tests"
    desc: >
      Some statistical tests or methods are not part of base R and were added to this package for convenience.
    contents:
    - "`g.test`"
    - "`kurtosis`"
    - "`skewness`"

  - title: "Other: deprecated functions"
    desc: >
      These functions are deprecated, meaning that they will still
      work but show a warning with every use and will be removed
      in a future version.
    contents:
    - "`AMR-deprecated`"
