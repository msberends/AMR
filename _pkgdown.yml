reference:
  - title: "Preparing data: microorganisms"
    desc: >
      These functions are meant to get taxonomically valid properties of microorganisms from any input.
      Use `mo_source()` to teach this package how to translate your own codes to valid microorganism codes.
    contents:
    - "`as.mo`"
    - "`mo_property`"
    - "`mo_source`"

  - title: "Preparing data: antibiotics"
    desc: >
      Use these functions to get valid properties of antibiotics from any input or to clean your input.
      You can even retrieve drug names and doses from clinical text records, using `ab_from_text()`.
    contents:
    - "`as.ab`"
    - "`ab_property`"
    - "`ab_from_text`"
    - "`atc_online_property`"

  - title: "Preparing data: antimicrobial resistance"
    desc: >
      With `as.mic()` and `as.disk()` you can transform your raw input to valid MIC or disk diffusion values.
      Use `as.rsi()` for cleaning raw data to let it only contain "R", "I" and "S", or to interpret MIC or disk diffusion values as R/SI based on the lastest EUCAST and CLSI guidelines.
      Afterwards, you can extend antibiotic interpretations by applying [EUCAST rules](https://www.eucast.org/expert_rules_and_intrinsic_resistance/) with `eucast_rules()`.
    contents:
    - "`as.rsi`"
    - "`as.mic`"
    - "`as.disk`"
    - "`eucast_rules`"
    - "`custom_eucast_rules`"

  - title: "Analysing data: antimicrobial resistance"
    desc: >
      Use these function for the analysis part. You can use `susceptibility()` or `resistance()` on any antibiotic column.
      Be sure to first select the isolates that are appropiate for analysis, by using `first_isolate()` or `is_new_episode()`.
      You can also filter your data on certain resistance in certain antibiotic classes (`carbapenems()`, `aminoglycosides()`), or determine multi-drug resistant microorganisms (MDRO, `mdro()`).
    contents:
    - "`proportion`"
    - "`count`"
    - "`is_new_episode`"
    - "`first_isolate`"
    - "`key_antimicrobials`"
    - "`mdro`"

  - title: "Background information on included data"
    desc: >
      Some pages about our package and its external sources. Be sure to read our [How To's](./../articles/index.html)
      for more information about how to work with functions in this package.

  - title: "Other: miscellaneous functions"
    desc: >
      These functions are mostly for internal use, but some of
      them may also be suitable for your analysis. Especially the
      'like' function can be useful: `if (x %like% y) {...}`.
    contents:
    - "`age_groups`"
    - "`age`"
    - "`availability`"
    - "`get_AMR_locale`"

    - "`pca`"
    - "`random`"

  - title: "Other: statistical tests"
    desc: >
      Some statistical tests or methods are not part of base R and were added to this package for convenience.
    contents:
    - "`g.test`"
    - "`kurtosis`"
    - "`skewness`"

  - title: "Other: deprecated functions"
    desc: >
      These functions are deprecated, meaning that they will still
      work but show a warning with every use and will be removed
      in a future version.
