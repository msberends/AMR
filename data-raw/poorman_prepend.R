# poorman: a package to replace all dplyr functions with base R so we can lose dependency on dplyr.
# These functions were downloaded from https://github.com/nathaneastwood/poorman,
# from this commit: https://github.com/nathaneastwood/poorman/tree/{commit}.
#
# All functions are prefixed with 'pm_' to make it obvious that they are dplyr substitutes.
