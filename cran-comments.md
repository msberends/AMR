As with all previous >20 releases, some CHECKs might return a NOTE for *just* hitting the installation size limit, though its size has been brought down to a minimum in collaboration with CRAN maintainers previously.

We consider this a high-impact package: it was published in the Journal of Statistical Software (2022), is included in a CRAN Task View (Epidemiology), and is according to download stats (cranlogs) used in almost all countries in the world. If there is anything to note, please let us know up-front without directly archiving the current version. That said, we continually unit test our package extensively and have no reason to assume that anything is wrong.

Thanks for maintaining and hosting CRAN! It's empowering R and its use enormously!
