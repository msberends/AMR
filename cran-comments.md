As with all previous >20 releases, some CHECKs on `oldrel` may return a `NOTE` for narrowly exceeding the installation size limit. This has been reduced to a minimum in prior coordination with CRAN maintainers and currently returns only an `INFO` on `release` and `devel`.

We treat this as a high-impact package: it was published in the *Journal of Statistical Software* (2022), is listed in the CRAN Task View "Epidemiology", and (based on cranlogs download statistics) is used globally. If there is anything to address, we would appreciate being informed before archiving the current version. We conduct extensive automated unit testing and have no indication of unresolved issues.

Thank you for your continued maintenance of CRAN, it plays a central role in the success and growth of the R ecosystem.
